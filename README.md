# 2Player_TicTacToe_WithComments

I initially started on tic-tac-toe as my main project but moved to whack-a-mole
when this one started to feel overwhelming. When I hit the random "play against
computer" section I got intimidated. Anyway, I finished what I had done today for
practice.

I left the comments in since this isn't the project I'm submitting for a grade.
